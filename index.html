      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words

    <p id="web-security-answer">
      There are a lot of different safety precautions to take when ensuring your
      website stays secure. It is not unusual to see passwords, email addresses,
      and bank details leaked through various websites. It is your
      responsibility, as a developer, to keep yourself and your users safe.
    </p>

    <p>
      The best place to start protecting your website is to address the most
      common risks first and keep yourself updated on what those may be. You may
      lower the chances of leaked passwords by setting policies for creating and
      renewing passwords. Or by implementing automatic user timeout, assuring
      the users credentials are not left unnecessarily long in the browser.

      Automatic solutions have become common practice, making less room for
      human error. For example, scanners help you seek out vulnerabilities and
      other issues in your website.

      Other recommended Web security practices include; Sanitization of data,
      making sure the data accepted by your system is in the right format. This
      is either done manually or through third-party solutions like NodeJS or
      sanitize-html. And CI/CD tools, giving you an automatic process monitoring
      changes and catching oversights from developers. It is also important to
      be wary of where you chose to host your website, to avoid attacks through
      the hosting platform. You should always keep your website up to date, and
      perform regular backups of your website. It is better to be safe than
      sorry.
